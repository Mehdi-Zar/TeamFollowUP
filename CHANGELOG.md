# Changelog

## 1.0 — V1 (production-ready)

First delivered version. Built on the initial tribe-steering tool, with the
following additions and a finalization pass.

### Squad content
- **Products & hardware** per squad: one or more product names, plus optional
  hardware names, set on squad **create/edit** (tribe leader / admin, and the
  squad leader for their own squad). Shown at the top of the squad page with the
  squad leader.
- **OTD** — the squad's committed annual objectives are surfaced at the top of the
  squad page (label "OTD"), above the detailed roadmap.
- **Key messages** — curated success / alert / risk notes per squad, timestamped
  (date & time), shown below the roadmap.
- **Budget tracking** — the tribe leader sets the **total** envelope; the squad
  leader reports **spent** (to date) and **forecast** (projected landing) + a
  comment. Status is derived from forecast (else spent) vs total:
  **on track** (< 90%) · **at risk** (90–100%) · **over** (> 100%, with overrun
  amount & %). **Visible only** to the admin, the tribe leader, and the squad's
  own leader (enforced server-side; a squad leader never sees another squad's
  budget, and cannot change the total).

### Exports
- Single-squad **HTML export** rendered with the application's own stylesheet and
  component markup, mirroring the squad page exactly (Initiatives → OTD →
  Roadmap → Key messages → Budget), without the global report scaffolding.
- Single-squad **PPTX export** restyled to match (navy header, white rounded
  cards, RAG badges, progress bars), same section order. Budget figures are
  gated to authorized viewers in both formats.

### Administration
- **Redesigned admin navigation**: a grouped left sidebar (Organisation ·
  Configuration · Authentification & Email · Modération & Journaux) replacing the
  flat tab bar. Sober, text-only, role-aware (empty groups hidden).

### Data & operations
- Real organization loaded (Cloud Foundations Tribe + product/transverse squads
  with products & hardware). One-shot scripts under `backend/scripts/`
  (`seed_real_org.py`, `prune_users.py`).
- Static `index.html` is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so a new build is
  always picked up (no stale SPA after deploy).

### Docs & housekeeping
- New **[Deployment Guide](docs/12-deployment-guide.md)** (VMware · GCP · S3NS ·
  AWS · Azure).
- Untracked compiled artifacts (`__pycache__`/`*.pyc`), removed Office temp lock
  files, hardened `.gitignore`, organized one-shot scripts.

### Migrations
- `0013` squad budget + key messages · `0014` budget forecast ·
  `0015` squad products & hardware.
